# NestJS Blog App

## Purpose
**NestJS Blog App** is a simple application that can handle blog posts just like medium, twitter, facebook. The real purpose for creating this application is to learn new technologies and practice creating software architecture that is scalable and highly-available

## Goals
* Proficiency in creating microservices in NestJS
* Excellence in systems design
* Excellence in CI/CD
* Learn Kubernetes
* Application monitoring

## Functional Requirements
- A user should be able to register to the platform
- A user should be able to create/update/delete a blog
- A user should be able to follow another user
- A user should have a _**home feed**_, which contains the blogs of users that the user follow
## Non-functional Requirements
- 50 million users create/update/delete blogs
- 100 million users read their home feed
- Fast response times
- Real-time updates
